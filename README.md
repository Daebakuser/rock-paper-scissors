# rock-paper-scissors

Time to demonstrate my freshly acquired JavaScript skills and
confirm my learning progress.

Get ready for some fun with the Rock, Paper, Scissors JavaScript
project from The Odin Project!
Faceoff against the computer to see who emerges victorious.

This project is currently playable through your browser's console,
but I'll revisit it to add a graphical user interface.


IMPLEMENTED AN INTERFACE AND REVISED JavaScript CODE.
The console days are over, as the game has been leveled up with a
graphical user interface to improve the user's gaming experience.

Rock on, Paper down, or Scissors through, it doesn't matter as long
as your having fun.

# rock-paper-scissors

Time to demonstrate my freshly acquired JavaScript skills and
confirm my learning progress.

project from The Odin Project!
Faceoff against the computer to see who emerges victorious.

This project is currently playable through your browser's console,
but I'll revisit it to add a graphical user interface.
